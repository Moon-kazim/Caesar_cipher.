# caesarCipherProgram
#we are going to make caesar cipher program  in 3 steps


# step_1
#TODO-1: Create a function called 'encrypt()' that takes 'original_text' and 'shift_amount' as 2 inputs.
#TODO-2: Inside the 'encrypt()' function, shift each letter of the 'original_text' forwards in the alphabet by the shift amount and print the encrypted text.
#TODO-4: What happens if you try to shift z forwards by 9? Can you fix the code?
#TODO-3: Call the 'encrypt()' function and pass in the user inputs. You should be able to test the code and encrypt a message.


# step_2
#TODO-1: Create a function called 'decrypt()' that takes 'original_text' and 'shift_amount' as inputs.
#TODO-2: Inside the 'decrypt()' function, shift each letter of the 'original_text' *backwards* in the alphabet by the shift amount and print the decrypted text.
#TODO-3: Combine the 'encrypt()' and 'decrypt()' functions into one function called 'caesar()'. Use the value of the user chosen 'direction' variable to determine which functionality to use.
